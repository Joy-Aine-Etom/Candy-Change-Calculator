Ino, a certified compulsive shopper and a well-known programmer, has been irked by cashiers saying they don‚Äôt have barya, or *‚ÄúPara masuklian kita nang buo, Sir, penge na lang ng singkwenta sentimos?‚Äù*, or *"Ok lang sir kung kendi ang sukli?"*. These scenes almost always annoy him but, apparently, he cannot do anything because he knows that, for years, it's how it's done in the Philippines.

One morning while in his office, Ino received a call from a well-known business tycoon. Apparently, this business mogul is offering him a hefty amount just for him to write a program to automatically determine the number of candies that will be given by the cashier if no amount of coins can make the change. Coincidence, eh?

Your task is to help Ino do this task.

### Input
The first line of input contains the number of data sets. Each data set will have 5 integers. The first number is the amount of change to make. The second number is the number of 10-peso coins available, followed by the number of 5-peso coins, then the number of 1-peso coins, and finally the number of 25-centavo coins.

### Output
For each line of data, print on screen the number of candies that must be given by the cashier If the amount of change can't be given exactly based on the given data. One candy is equivalent to 1 peso. If no candy is needed, print "none"

<br />

### Sample Input
```sh
3
2 10 10 1 0
5 10 0 4 5
10 0 1 0 19
```

### Sample Output
```sh
1
none
1
```
